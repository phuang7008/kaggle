str(all_data)
```
From the data, we see that no factor variable is created as read_csv() default to not produce any factors

Feature Engineering

The name field contains title for each person. Let's get them out and add new variable named Title

```{r}
all_data$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', all_data$Name)

# show the count information by sex
table(all_data$Sex, all_data$Title)

# some titles are rare, replace them with 'rare_title'
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')

# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
all_data$Title[all_data$Title == 'Mlle'] <- 'Miss'
all_data$Title[all_data$Title == 'Ms']   <- 'Miss'
all_data$Title[all_data$Title == 'Mme']  <- 'Mrs'
all_data$Title[all_data$Title %in% rare_title] <- 'Rare'

# output the count information again
table(all_data$Sex, all_data$Title)
```
2.2 Do families sink or swim together?
Now that we've taken care of splitting passenger name into some new variables, we can take it a step further and make some new family variables. First we're going to make a family size variable based on number of siblings/spouse(s) (maybe someone has more than one spouse?) and number of children/parents.
```{r}
# finally, let's try to get the surname out
all_data$Surname <- sapply(all_data$Name, 
                           function(x) strsplit(x, split='[,.]')[[1]][1])
cat(paste('We have <b>', 
          nlevels(factor(all_data$Surname)), '</b> unique surnames.'))

# Create a family size variable including the passenger themselves
all_data$Fsize <- all_data$SibSp + all_data$Parch + 1

# Create a Family variable
all_data$Family <- paste(all_data$Surname, all_data$Fsize, sep='_')

# What does our family size variable look like? To help us understand how it may relate to survival, let's plot it among the training data, as only training dataset contains the survival information
g <- ggplot(all_data[1:891,], aes(Fsize, fill=factor(Survived)))
g + geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:11)) + labs(x='Family Size') + theme_few()
```
We can see that there's a survival penalty to singletons and those with family sizes above 4. We can collapse this variable into three levels which will be helpful since there are comparatively fewer large families. Let's create a discretized family size variable.
```{r}
all_data$FsizeD[all_data$Fsize == 1] <- 'singleton'
all_data$FsizeD[all_data$Fsize <= 4 & all_data$Fsize >1] <- 'small'
all_data$FsizeD[all_data$Fsize > 4] <- 'large'

# Show family size by survival using a mosaic plot
mosaicplot(table(all_data$FsizeD, all_data$Survived), main='Family Size by Survival', shade=TRUE)


```
The mosaic plot shows that we preserve our rule that there's a survival penalty among singletons and large families, but a benefit for passengers in small families. I want to do something further with our age variable, but 263 rows have missing age values, so we will have to wait until after we address missingness.

2.3 Treat a few more variables .
What's left? There's probably some potentially useful information in the passenger cabin variable including about their deck. Let's take a look.

```{r}
# This variable appears to have a lot of missing values
all_data$Cabin[1:28]

# The first character is the deck. For example:
strsplit(all_data$Cabin[2], '')[[1]]
strsplit(all_data$Cabin[2], NULL)[[1]]

# Create a Deck variable. Get passenger deck A - F:
all_data$Deck <- factor(sapply(all_data$Cabin, function(x) strsplit(x, split='')[[1]][1]))
```
There's more that likely could be done here including looking into cabins with multiple rooms listed (e.g., row 28: "C23 C25 C27"), but given the sparseness of the column we'll stop here.

3 Missingness
Now we're ready to start exploring missing data and rectifying it through imputation. There are a number of different ways we could go about doing this. Given the small size of the dataset, we probably should not opt for deleting either entire observations (rows) or variables (columns) containing missing values. We're left with the option of either replacing missing values with a sensible values given the distribution of the data, e.g., the mean, median or mode. Finally, we could go with prediction. We'll use both of the two latter methods and I'll rely on some data visualization to guide our decisions.
```{r}
# 3.1 Sensible value imputation
filter(train, is.na(train$Embarked))

# Passengers 62 and 830 are missing Embarkment
all_data[c(62, 830), 'Embarked']
#filter(train, train$PassengerId == 62)

# let's try to find out the Pclass and fare they have paid
print(train[c(62,830), c("Fare", "Pclass")])

# Therefore, is it possible for us to find out where they embarked
# let's graph it, but first we need to remove these two entries
df1 <- all_data %>% filter(!is.na(Embarked))
str(df1)

# visualization: Pclass vs 'median' Fare vs Embarkment
gf <- ggplot(df1, aes(x=Embarked, y=Fare, fill=factor(Pclass)))
gf <- gf + geom_boxplot()
gf <- gf + geom_hline(aes(yintercept=80), colour='red', linetype='dashed', lwd=2)
gf + scale_y_continuous(labels=dollar_format()) + theme_few()
```
Voilà! The median fare for a first class passenger departing from Charbourg ('C') coincides nicely with the $80 paid by our embarkment-deficient passengers. I think we can safely replace the NA values with 'C'.
```{r}
all_data$Embarked[is.na(all_data$Embarked)] <- 'C'
all_data[c(62, 830), 'Embarked']
```
We're close to fixing the handful of NA values here and there. Passenger on row 1044 has an NA Fare value.
```{r}
all_data[c(1044), c('Fare', 'Pclass', 'Embarked')]
```
Again, we can use graph to visualize the median fare paid by those passengers who embarked at 'S' port and with Pclass in 3; Here try not to use all_data$Fare as it includes everything. However, here we only interested in a subset of that data!
```{r}
ga <- ggplot(all_data[all_data$Pclass == 3 & all_data$Embarked == 'S',], aes(x=Fare))
ga <- ga + geom_density(fill='#99d6ff', alpha=0.4)
ga <- ga + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(Fare, na.rm=T)), colour='red', linetype='dashed', lwd=1)
ga+theme_few()
```
From this visualization, it seems quite reasonable to replace the NA Fare value with median for their class and embarkment which is $8.05.
```{r}
all_data[c(1044), 'Fare'] <- median(all_data[all_data$Pclass==3 & all_data$Embarked=='S',]$Fare, na.rm=T)
all_data[c(1044), 'Fare']
```
3.2 Predictive imputation
Finally, as we noted earlier, there are quite a few missing Age values in our data. We are going to get a bit more fancy in imputing missing age values. Why? Because we can. We will create a model predicting ages based on other variables.
```{r}
# how many 'Age' value missing?
sum(is.na(all_data$Age))
```
We could definitely use 'rpart' (recursive partitioning for regression) to predict missing ages, but we are going to use the 'mice' package for this task just for something different.  
```{r}
# first factorize the factor variables (b/c the read_csv default to no factorization) and then perform mice imputation.
factor_variables <- c('Pclass', 'PassengerId', 'Sex', 
                      'Embarked', 'Title', 'Surname', 'Family', 'FsizeD')

all_data[factor_variables] <- 
  lapply(all_data[factor_variables], function(x) as.factor(x))
str(all_data)
```
Perform imputation!
```{r}
library(mice)

# set random seed
set.seed(151)

# perform 'mice' impuration, exclude some less-than-useful variables
excluded <- c('PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'Family',  'Surname', 'Survived')
mice_mod <- mice(all_data[, !names(all_data) %in% excluded], method='rf')
```
Save the results and  compare the results we get with the original distribution of passenger ages to ensure that nothing has gone completely awry.
```{r}
# save the imputation results
mice_output <- complete(mice_mod)

# draw 'Age' distribution before and after
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(all_data$Age, freq=F, main="Age: Original Data", col="darkgreen", ylim=c(0,0.04))
hist(mice_output$Age, freq=F, main="Age: After Impuration", col='lightgreen', ylim=c(0, 0.04))
```
Things look good, so let's replace our age vector in the original data with the output from the mice model.
```{r}
all_data$Age <- mice_output$Age

# check to see if there is still any missing Age values left
sum(is.na(all_data$Age))
```
3.3 Feature Engineering: Round 2
Now that we know everyone's age, we can create a couple of new age-dependent variables: Child and Mother. A child will simply be someone under 18 years of age and a mother is a passenger who is 1) female, 2) is over 18, 3) has more than 0 children (no kidding!), and 4) does not have the title 'Miss'.
```{r}
# is there any relationship between Sex, Age and Survival? Let's graph the training data first
gs <- ggplot(all_data[1:891,], aes(Age, fill=factor(Survived)))
gs + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(.~Sex) + theme_few()
```
```{r}
warnings()
# create a column called 'Child' to indicate if the person is child or adult
all_data$Child[all_data$Age < 18]  <- 'Child'
all_data$Child[all_data$Age >= 18] <- 'Adult'

# show count against Survival
table(all_data$Child, all_data$Survived)
```
Looks like being a child doesn't hurt, but it's not going to necessarily save you either! We will finish off our feature engineering by creating the Mother variable. Maybe we can hope that mothers are more likely to have survived on the Titanic.
```{r}
# add mother variable
all_data$Mother <- 'Not Mother'

all_data$Mother[all_data$Child == 'Adult' & all_data$Sex == 'female' & all_data$Parch > 0 & all_data$Title != 'Miss'] <- "Mother"

table(all_data$Mother, all_data$Survived)
```
```{r}
# Finish by factorizing our two new factor variables
all_data$Child <- factor(all_data$Child)
all_data$Mother <- factor(all_data$Mother)
```

All of the variables we care about should be taken care of and there should be no missing data. I'm going to double check just to be sure:
```{r}
md.pattern(all_data)

# let save the results for future use
write.csv(all_data, file='final_train.csv', row.names=FALSE)
```
